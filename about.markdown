# Who is Per?

Seasoned developer with broad spectrum of interest with a slight inclination to server side stuff. But that's changing. Loves clean architecture, nice languages, pragmatic approaches. Dislikes over-engineering, limiting licensing, narrow-mindedness, and coding style talibans. Also does photography, choir singing, cooking, playing with Arduios and collect Swedish crystal. Sometimes I have humor, says my man, but I'm not certain.

Haven't had enough of me? [Follow me on Twitter][twitter]. You may [contact me][contact] with questions or comments.

And should you care, this is what I sometimes look like:
